# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a generalist, fullstack software engineer with a passion for problem-solving and understanding the motivations behind software solutions.

ðŸš€ **Journey:** I started my programming journey in 2016 and have gained experience in PHP, C#, Java, and TypeScript. While I've dabbled in various languages, TypeScript is my mainstay.

ðŸ›  **Methodology:** I adhere to Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles to ensure robust and reliable code. Writing tests and thinking about software design from the outset is crucial to my workflow.

ðŸ’» **Expertise:** Professionally, I specialize in developing mobile and web applications using TypeScript. I love diving deep into software design, architecture, and testing, always striving to create well-structured and maintainable codebases.

ðŸŽ¨ **Frontend Development:** I have a strong affinity for frontend development. Creating intuitive and engaging user interfaces is something I find particularly rewarding.

ðŸ§© **Problem-Solving:** My true passion lies in understanding the problems that motivate the creation of software solutions. It's not just about the end result, but about comprehending the reasons behind architectural choices and design patterns. This investigative approach is a lot of fun for me and drives my continuous learning and growth.
